Given an array of numbers, find the longest sub-array that contains at most two unique values

Area
	take your point and find the distance to each of the four corners. 
	If each distance is less than a, you've got a bingo
	
Treasure
	Read in input cleanly! Then use Horner's Rule
	
Is this integration?
	Take Simpson's picture
	Angle BAC is 90
	Angle BAF is 60
	Angle BEC is 60
	Therefore, Angle BEF is 30
	
	Find area of square in center
	Then take the cone BEF (including the rounded bit)
		area of cone is pi * s^2 * 30/360
	Then find area of triangle and subtract
	
	Then find length EF
	
Heron's Rule
	calculate area of a triangle where you know the length of the sides, a, b, and c.
	s = (a + b + c) / 2 //half of the triangle's perimeter
	A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))
