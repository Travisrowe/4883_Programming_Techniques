1. Read Problem
2. Read in data & Write out data
3. Think and design your algorithm on paper
4. Is the complexity of 3 good?
5. If not go to 3
6. Code algorithm
7. Run and test on a lot of data

Sorting is nlog(n) complexity
    STL has sort algorithm already
    
Reading in a file after creating a project
    for reference: UVa submission format on Simpson's page
