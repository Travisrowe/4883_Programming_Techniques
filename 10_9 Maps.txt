Maps are similar to dictionary in python

Map A;
A["Nice"] = 1; //searches map A for "Nice", if it's not in the map, it adds "Nice" to the map and assigns it as 1

Map is actually a red-black tree, which has an O(log(n)) search time
Unordered Map uses a Hash table, which has an O(1) search time
    Hash tables use a lot of memory (more than twice the size of N), so in huge datasets it could be too much memory...
