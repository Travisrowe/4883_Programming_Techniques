longest common subsequence
	the ith prefix is defined as the first i characters of the sequence
	e.g. sequence = "zyabxftv", sequence(4) = "zyab"
	
	Optimal substructure of an LCS
		Let C = x1x2x3... xm and Y = y1y2y3... yn and let Z = z1z2z3... zk be any LCS of X and Y
		if xm = yn, append that letter at zk.
		this can be done using two loops, one through x and one through y, making this an n^2 algorithm
		
	You actually store the length of the LCS in your solution matrix Z. The reason you don't store the
	sub-sequence is because there can be multiple answers. While the lengths of these answers are equivalent
	the actual sequences are not.

	2D problem 
		given a matrix of numbers, find the sum from any given grid i,j to another grid k,l.
		start by storing in every grid, the sum from 0,0 to i,j, where i,j is the index of that grid
		Then, when you want to find the sum of square i,j to k,l
			A = k,l
			B = i - 1, j - 1
			C = k, j - 1
			D = i - 1, l
			
			Answer = A - C - (D - B)
