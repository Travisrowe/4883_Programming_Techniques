Test problem 2, get the max of a line of integers
    int x;
    cin >> line;
    streamstring ss(line); //use ss like cin to read in integers, so then you have
    ss >> x;
    
Problem 3: RingSum
    Use an & when you pass a matrix into a function!
    
Problem 4: Vowels have Value
    Switch statement is order(N) vs ASCII table is order(1)
    
    string vowels = "AEIOU"
;    vector<char> ASCIItbl(128, 0) //set all to 0
    for(int i = 0; i < 5l i++)
        Table[vowels[i]] = value[i]; //only vowels have values now, all else are 0
        
Problem 5: Consecutive products
    Don't need to set a length, you just set a start position i and an end position j
    
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        product = 1;
        for(int j = i; j < N; j++)
            product *= A[j];
            if(product > maxProd)
                maxProd = product;
                
    ALSO! integer only allows 9 digits
        long allows some shit.
        long long allows 18 digits! which is what was needed for this problem
